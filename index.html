<span class="bodytext">
&ldquo;Packet Storm Ltd, through Dimitrios Siganos, helped us successfully Integrate
Linux with Qt and webkit for a consumer touch screen product. Packet Storm
found and successfully collaborated with Hedera Innovations Ltd to deliver the
project on time and on budget within very tight timescales. I highly recommend
Packet Storm's services and would happily do business with them again.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Dimitri has the rare ability to quickly get familiar with code written by others and start tackling issues you will hire him to fix. Ignore his technical recommendations at your peril.&rdquo;

<span class="smallredtext">David Sansom, Director of Software, UMTS Femto, Airvana</span><br />

&ldquo;Dimitrios is a very capable and diligent engineer, we are very pleased with his work. It's been a pleasure to work with him.&rdquo;

<span class="smallredtext">Piotr Galecki, Consulting Software Engineer, Airvana</span><br />
<span class="bodytext">
&ldquo;I worked with Dimitrios in Airvana on two projects. Implementing PPPoE
and then on implementing TPM support in a UMTS Femtocell product. Dimitrios was
able to come up to speed on new technology very quickly. He is very talented
and self motivated. Although I was working as a technical lead I spent little
time with Dimitrios consulting the work. I highly recommend him.&rdquo;
